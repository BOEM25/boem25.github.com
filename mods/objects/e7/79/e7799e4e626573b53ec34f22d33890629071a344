    # Set requirements for items in this list. Each entry is composed of the item key and the requirements
    # The item key is in the simple mod:item_id format. Optionally, it can be in mod:item_id:metadata, if you want to match metadata.
    # The requirements are in a comma separated list, each in a key|value format. For example, to make an iron pickaxe require 5 mining
    # and 5 building, you'd use the following string:
    # "minecraft:iron_pickaxe=mining|5,building|5"
    # 
    # Item usage can also be locked behind an advancement, by using adv|id. For example, to make the elytra require the "Acquire Hardware." advancement
    # you'd use the following string:
    # "minecraft:elytra=adv|minecraft:story/smelt_iron"
    # 
    # Skill requirements and advancements can be mixed and matched, so you can make an item require both, if you want.
    # You can also lock placed blocks from being used or broken, in the same manner.

    # Locks defined here apply to all the following cases: Right clicking an item, placing a block, breaking a block, using a block that's placed,
    # left clicking an item, using an item to break any block, and equipping an armor item.
    # 
    # You can lock entire mods by just using their name as the left argument. You can then specify specific items to not be locked,
    # by defining their lock in the normal way.
